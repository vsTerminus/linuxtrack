DEPENDENCIES:

Check https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/linuxtrack but note this is a fork of a fork which builds on qt5, so you don't need qt4 or qtwebkit.

	cwiid
	libusb
	mxml
	opencv
	v4l-utils
	zlib
	bison
	gcc-obj-multilib
	gdb
	xplane-sdk-devel (Optional???)
	qt5-base
	nsis


BUILD:

	autoreconf
    	./configure
    	make


INSTALL:

	sudo make install

UDEV:

    	sudo cp src/99-TIR.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
    	sudo udevadm --reload
    	sudo udevadm trigger

	Distros other than Arch might be slightly different for the udev part, but basically get the rules file into a udev rules.d folder and restart udev.


RUN:

	ltr_gui

	If errors, check the Misc tab there is a View Log button that will tell you what the app is looking for and not finding.


FIRMWARE:

	If you are dual booting you can grab your NaturalPoint folder from C:\Program Files (x86) and point ltr_gui there to install firmware "From unpacked".
	If you are not, you need the installer and can either point it at the installer or use WINE to install TrackIR in a WINE Prefix and then point ltr_gui at that installation instead.


WINE BRIDGE:

	First you need to know the path to your WINEPREFIX for the game you're playing. For a default installtion this will be
	~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/<steam game id>/pfx

	MSFS2020 for example is 1250410
	You an see a list ids for your installed Steam games with `protontricks --gui`

	Now you can install the WINE Bridge and its dependencies into the prefix:
	
	WINEPREFIX=~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/1250410/pfx winetricks -q vcrun6 mfc42
	WINEPREFIX=~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/1250410/pfx wine src/wine_bridge/linuxtrack-wine.exe

	Once they are installed you can test it out by running
	WINEPREFIX=~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/1250410/pfx wine explorer

	Navigate to C:\Program Files (x86)\Linuxtrack
	Make sure you can run Controller.exe (and define your hotkeys) and TrackIR.exe.


STEAMTINKERLAUNCH:

	The last step is to be able to launch the WINE Bridge and then the game you want to play, in the same prefix, in that order.
	Current versions of Proton will not allow this, as they refuse to start the game if something is already running, and lock the prefix after they launch the game.
	The way around this is by installing Steamtinkerlaunch and setting the game to use that as its Compatibility Layer in Steam.
